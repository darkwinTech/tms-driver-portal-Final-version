// Status-transition rules, ported verbatim from frontend/src/mock/workflow.js.
// Each request type has its own path since Operations acts on them differently:
//
// - Create Driver: Operations is the first review stage. Two distinct
//   negative outcomes at review time: "Returned to Requester" is
//   non-terminal (the requester can edit and resubmit - resubmission resets
//   the status to Submitted), while "Rejected" is a terminal dead end.
//   "Processing – Operations Team" is where Operations completes the hidden
//   driver-profile fields (Group/Customer, Driver Class, Operating Hours).
//   Completing the profiles ("Complete Driver Profiles") now ALSO sends
//   the ServiceNow handoff email (via serviceNowEmailService.js) immediately,
//   then hands the request over to the AD Team ("AD Team Review"). The AD
//   Team's only remaining action is to confirm the external AD work is
//   done ("Mark as Complete") - they no longer trigger RPA and no longer
//   have a reject option at this stage.
//
// - Modify Driver: there's no account action to perform, so Operations
//   decides directly from Submitted - Accept completes the request
//   immediately (and writes the change onto the driver's record), Reject is
//   terminal. The AD Team is never involved. Unaffected by the RPA-trigger
//   timing change above.
//
// - Disable Driver: Operations decides directly from Submitted too, but
//   Accept doesn't complete the request - it now triggers RPA AND hands off
//   to the AD Team ("AD Team Review") in the same action, since disabling
//   the account is their job. The AD Team then confirms with "Mark as
//   Complete", same as Create Driver.
